### README: Analysis of AZD7442CE Cohort Data

#### Overview

This project involves analyzing various datasets related to the AZD7442CE cohort. The objective is to process and derive insights from the provided data files, which include information on cohort encounters, demographics, and outcomes.

#### Files Included

1. **AZD7442CE_COHORTS_ALL_COHORT_ENCOUNTERS_ISPREP.xlsx**: Contains data on all cohort encounters.
2. **AZD7442CE_COHORTS_CASE_COHORT_INDEX_ENCOUNTER.xlsx**: Contains data on index encounters for the case cohort.
3. **AZD7442CE_COHORTS_COHORT_DEMOGRAPHICS.xlsx**: Contains demographic information for the cohort.
4. **AZD7442CE_COHORTS_CONTROL_COHORT_ENCOUNTERS.xlsx**: Contains data on encounters for the control cohort.
5. **died.xlsx**: Contains data related to patient outcomes, specifically mortality.
6. **IC Sub Cohort Distribution (1).csv**: Contains data on the distribution of the IC sub-cohort.
7. **try1.py**: A Python script to perform preliminary data processing and analysis.

#### Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- openpyxl (for reading Excel files)
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl seaborn
```

#### Steps to Run the Analysis

1. **Setup Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed.
   - Place all the provided data files in the same directory as the Python script.

2. **Running the Script:**
   - The provided script `try1.py` performs preliminary data processing and analysis.
   - You can run the script using the command:
     ```bash
     python try1.py
     ```

3. **Understanding the Script:**
   - The script reads the data from the provided files, processes it, and generates preliminary insights.
   - It includes code to handle and clean the data, merge datasets, and visualize key metrics.

4. **Analyzing the Results:**
   - After running the script, check the output for insights and visualizations.
   - The script will output data summaries and plots that help understand the cohort characteristics and outcomes.
